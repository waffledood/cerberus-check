   -> to read LOH, TTL & LRR values from Tableau (underlying Excel data)
    * to set it as a function, return list of lists, each list (Segment Name, LOH, TTL, LRR)

3) ???.py

   -> imports the earlier 2 programs 
    * read & iterate through the lists from the 2 programs & compares the LRR values.
